        ">We built an artificial intelligence model by fine-tuning [GPT-2](https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/) to generate tweets in the style of Donald Trump’s Twitter account. After seeing the results, we also built a discriminator that can accurately detect fake tweets 77% of the time — think you can beat our classifier? Try it yourself!\n",

        "GPT-2 is a neural transformer-based model, that has been announced by OpenAI in February 2019 and created considerable discussion because they decided - in contrast to their earlier policies - not to release the mode to the public. Their central argument was that the model could be used to produce fake news, spam and alike too easily. The footnote of the faketrump page reads: “Generating realistic fake text has become much more accessible. We hope to highlight the current state of text generation to demonstrate how difficult it is to discern fiction from reality.”\n",

        "Having no dataset from that project, Roman decided to retrain GPT2 to generate new fake trump tweets. If they can do that, we can do that!

Congresswomen on your incredibly important blockage last night of a FISA Bill that would just perpetuate the abuse that produced the Greatest Political Crime In the History of the U.S., the Russian Witch-Hunt.', 'The Impeachment Hoax is interfering with the 2020 Election - But that was the idea behind the Radical Left, Do Nothing Dems Scam attack.', 'We will be, by mutual consent, temporarily closing our Northern Border with Canada to non-essential traffic.', 'The men and women of the National Guard have been doing a great job fighting the CoronaVirus.', 'Twitter makes sure that Trending on Twitter is anything bad, Fake or not, about President Donald Trump.', 'Thank you to our great American businesses for going above and beyond to keep our most vulnerable citizens safe!', 'So ridiculous to see Twitter trying to make the case that Mail-In Ballots are not subject to FRAUD.', 'If people can go out and protest, riot, break into stores, and create all sorts of havoc, they can also go out and VOTE — and keep our Election Honest.', 'There is a group of people (largely Radical Left Democrats) that want ELECTION MAYHEM.', 'The big Unsolicited Ballot States should give it up NOW, before it is too late, and ask people to go to the Polling Booths and, like always before, VOTE.', 'Because of the new and unprecedented massive amount of unsolicited ballots which will be sent to “voters”, or wherever, this year, the Nov 3rd Election result may NEVER BE ACCURATELY DETERMINED, which is what some want.', 'Great credit being given for our Coronavirus response, except in the Fake News.', '.....would order a new trial, I’m not so sure about Judge Jackson, I don’t know.” (Andrew Napolitano)', '.....existence of these tweets in which you were so harshly negative about the President &amp; the people who support him.', '“Judge Jackson now has a request for a new trial based on the unambiguous &amp; self outed bias of the foreperson of the jury, whose also a lawyer, by the way.', 'I was honored to be back in Georgia with a truly incredible organization—BLACK VOICES FOR TRUMP, where I announced a brand new plan to deliver more opportunity, more security, more fairness, and more prosperity to black communities.', '...And I look at them as a bunch of well funded ANARCHISTS &amp; THUGS who are protected because the Comey/Mueller inspired FBI is simply unable, or unwilling, to find their funding source, and allows them to get away with “murder”.', 'The White House Press Conference will take place today at 1:00 P.M., recognizing that it is Good Friday!', 'These were Mueller prosecutors, and the whole Mueller investigation was illegally set up based on a phony and now fully discredited Fake Dossier, lying and forging documents to the FISA Court, and many other things.']\n"
