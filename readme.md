# Portfolios for SDSPhD20



This repository contains portfolio notebooks for the AAU PhD course "Social Data Science: An applied introduction to machine learning", November 2020.



The folder "compilation" contains a notebook compiling solutions from various portfolios.



Each participant has a folder with their solutions. The folder is either an upload of notebooks shared via Google Colab or a reference (submodule) to their own repository on GitHub with their notebooks.
