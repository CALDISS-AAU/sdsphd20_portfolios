Various members' attributes are also part of the dataset, including seniority, formal status, office in which they work, gender, lawschool attended, individual performance measurements (hours worked, fees brought in), attitudes concerning various management policy options, etc. This dataset was used to identify social processes such as bounded solidarity, lateral control, quality control, knowledge sharing, balancing powers, regulation, etc. among peers.\n",

After seeing the results, we also built a discriminator that can accurately detect fake tweets 77% of the time — think you can beat our classifier? Try it yourself!\n",

Their central argument was that the model could be used to produce fake news, spam and alike too easily. The footnote of the faketrump page reads: “Generating realistic fake text has become much more accessible. We hope to highlight the current state of text generation to demonstrate how difficult it is to discern fiction from reality.”\n",
